## Description: 
The player controls a sphere that moves forward automatically on an infinite floor. The floor is divided into three lanes. The player needs to dodge obstacles while managing both ability and health points in order to avoid dying. The player encounters Col- lectibles: that can be found along the road and collecting them increases the player’s resources; and Obstacles: that can be found along the road and touching them decreases the player’s health points (more about that in the sections that follow). The player’s goal is to achieve the highest score possible before losing all their health points.
